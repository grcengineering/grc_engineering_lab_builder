## 📝 Tips for Job Seekers

### Treat Learning Labs as Portfolio Projects
Every lab you complete is a project you can discuss in interviews. Document your work and be ready to walk through your approach.

### Focus on Demonstrable Skills
"I completed a course on risk management" < "I built a quantitative vendor risk scoring model and tested it on 50 public companies"

### Build in Public
Share your learning journey on LinkedIn. Recruiters notice people actively building GRC skills.

### Be Honest About Gaps
"I haven't done formal TPRM yet, but I built this assessment framework to teach myself. Here's what I learned..." is compelling.

### Time Your Projects Strategically
Build projects that match the roles you're applying for. If targeting TPRM roles, do vendor assessment projects.
