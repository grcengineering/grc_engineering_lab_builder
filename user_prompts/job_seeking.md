## üìù Tips for Success

**Build in Public:** Share your progress on LinkedIn as you go. "Week 2 of building a vendor risk scoring model - just figured out how to normalize qualitative inputs!" gets attention.

**Focus on Business Value:** Your project should solve a real GRC problem, not just be a technical exercise. "Built Python script" < "Reduced SOC 2 review time by 75%"

**Document Everything:** Your future self (and interviewers) will thank you. README files and blog posts force you to articulate your thinking.

**Be Honest About Limitations:** "This uses sample data, but in production I'd need to address X, Y, Z" shows mature thinking.

**Iterate After Feedback:** After first interview where you present this, refine based on questions you struggled with.
