## üìù Tips for Success

**Solve Real Problems:** Don't build something because it's interesting technically. Build what you actually need. If you're dreading a task, automate it.

**Start With Quick Wins:** Pick a problem that drives you crazy and takes 5+ hours/week. Time savings are easy to measure and leadership notices.

**Document Everything:** Your future self and your manager will thank you. "I saved 15 hours/week" with a runbook is promotion-worthy.

**Show Your Work:** Don't wait until it's perfect. Share progress with your manager: "Week 2 of building X, already seeing Y benefit."

**Think Beyond Yourself:** If your solution could help others on your team, document it for sharing. This positions you as a leader.
