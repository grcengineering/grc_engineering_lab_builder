## PROJECT FOCUS

Learning Objective: Build [DELIVERABLE - e.g., "automated SOC 2 review process", "executive risk dashboard", "vendor risk scoring framework", "control testing workflow", "board presentation template", "GRC automation script"]

Business Problem I'm Solving: [SPECIFIC_PROBLEM - e.g., "Spending 15 hours/week on manual vendor reviews", "CFO wants data-driven risk reporting and I have spreadsheets", "Board keeps asking questions I can't answer quickly", "Control testing is ad-hoc and inconsistent", "Can't scale current processes as company grows"]

Impact I Want to Achieve: [MEASURABLE_GOAL - e.g., "Reduce vendor review time from 3 hours to 45 minutes each", "Create dashboard that updates automatically for quarterly board meetings", "Cut manual data entry from 10 hours/week to 1 hour/week", "Establish repeatable framework I can train team on"]

Strategic Value: [WHY_THIS_MATTERS - e.g., "Will free up 60% of my time for strategic work", "Demonstrates value for upcoming promotion conversation", "Positions me as technical leader on the team", "Solves pain point leadership keeps complaining about"]

---

## MY CURRENT SITUATION

Role & Responsibilities: [CURRENT_ROLE - e.g., "TPRM Analyst managing 500+ vendors", "GRC Manager building program from scratch", "Senior Risk Analyst supporting board reporting", "Compliance Lead for SOC 2/ISO 27001"]

Time Spent on Manual Work: [BREAKDOWN - e.g., "20 hours/week on vendor reviews, 10 hours on reporting, 5 hours on evidence collection", "Most time on repetitive document analysis", "Constantly firefighting instead of strategic work"]

Current Tools & Processes: [WHAT_EXISTS - e.g., "Google Sheets for tracking, manual PDF reviews", "OneTrust GRC platform but not using it effectively", "Excel-based control library and risk register", "No automation, everything manual"]

Team & Resources: [CONTEXT - e.g., "Team of 1 (just me)", "Team of 3 but I'm only technical person", "Matrixed team across security/legal/compliance", "Budget exists but need to prove ROI first"]

---

## PROJECT URGENCY

Timeline Driver: [WHY_NOW - e.g., "Board meeting in 6 weeks and need dashboard", "Performance review in 3 months", "Company scaling fast and current process breaking", "New initiative launching Q1"]

Other Commitments: [CONSTRAINTS - e.g., "Busy season coming up", "Audit prep happening parallel", "Can only work on this during slow periods"]

---

## DELIVERABLES & ARTIFACTS

The lab should result in:

### Core Working Solution
[MAIN_DELIVERABLE - e.g., "Python script that parses SOC 2 PDFs and outputs structured data", "PowerBI dashboard connected to GRC platform", "Risk scoring model in Excel with documentation", "Automated workflow using Google Apps Script", "Control testing playbook with templates"]

### Documentation for Stakeholders
Create materials to share this work:
- **Manager/Leadership:** [AUDIENCE_APPROPRIATE - e.g., "One-pager showing time savings and ROI", "Executive summary with before/after metrics", "Business case for expanding this approach"]
- **Team/Peers:** [PRACTICAL_DOCS - e.g., "Runbook so others can use it", "Training guide for handoff", "Best practices documentation"]
- **Future You:** [MAINTENANCE - e.g., "Troubleshooting guide", "Notes on how to enhance later", "Lessons learned writeup"]

### Internal Presentation
Guidance for presenting this work including:
- **To my manager:** [PITCH_ANGLE - e.g., "Quantified time savings and propose expanding scope", "Position as foundation for larger automation initiative", "Use as evidence for promotion/raise conversation"]
- **To executives:** [EXECUTIVE_FRAMING - e.g., "Business value and risk reduction", "How this scales with company growth", "ROI calculation and next steps"]
- **To my team:** [PEER_LEVEL - e.g., "Technical walkthrough and training", "How they can use it or adapt it", "Collaborative improvement ideas"]

### Success Metrics
Define how I'll measure impact:
- **Quantitative:** [HARD_METRICS - e.g., "Time savings: 15 hours/week → 3 hours/week", "Vendor review time: 3 hours → 45 minutes", "Error rate reduction: 15% → 2%"]
- **Qualitative:** [SOFT_BENEFITS - e.g., "Faster response to ad-hoc leadership questions", "More consistent risk scoring across analysts", "Freed up time for strategic projects"]
- **Career Impact:** [VISIBILITY - e.g., "Positioned for promotion", "Recognized as technical leader", "Invited to contribute to other initiatives"]

## SUCCESS CRITERIA

I'll know this lab is successful if:
- [ ] I deliver a working solution I actually use in my job
- [ ] Leadership recognizes the value (bonus/promotion/expanded scope)
- [ ] The solution is maintainable (doesn't break after 2 weeks)
- [ ] I learn skills I can apply to other problems
- [ ] Time saved is measurable and significant
- [ ] I feel more effective and less overwhelmed in my role

## PROJECT ASPIRATIONS

What Would Make This a "Home Run": [IDEAL_OUTCOME - e.g., "Leadership asks me to roll this out company-wide", "I present this at all-hands and get recognition", "This becomes the standard way we do this process", "I teach this to other teams and become internal expert"]

Biggest Fear/Concern: [HONEST_WORRY - e.g., "I'll spend time on this and leadership won't care", "It'll break and I won't know how to fix it", "I'll get pulled into other fires and never finish", "Someone will say we already tried this and it didn't work"]
```

## 📝 Tips for Success

**Solve Real Problems:** Don't build something because it's interesting technically. Build what you actually need. If you're dreading a task, automate it.

**Start With Quick Wins:** Pick a problem that drives you crazy and takes 5+ hours/week. Time savings are easy to measure and leadership notices.

**Document Everything:** Your future self and your manager will thank you. "I saved 15 hours/week" with a runbook is promotion-worthy.

**Show Your Work:** Don't wait until it's perfect. Share progress with your manager: "Week 2 of building X, already seeing Y benefit."

**Think Beyond Yourself:** If your solution could help others on your team, document it for sharing. This positions you as a leader.
