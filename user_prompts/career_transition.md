---

## TRANSITION CONTEXT

**Note:** Your previous role and background are already captured in your_grc_profile.md (Previous Career/Background field). Reference that here.

New GRC Role: [NEW_ROLE - e.g., "GRC Program Manager", "Third-Party Risk Analyst", "Risk & Compliance Lead", "Vendor Security Manager"]

Time in Role: [DURATION - e.g., "Starting in 2 weeks", "30 days in", "Just hit 60-day mark", "First week complete"]

---

## MY TRANSITION ADVANTAGES

**Note:** Your technical strengths and gaps are already in your_grc_profile.md. Focus here on HOW to position them.

How My Previous Experience Helps in GRC:
- [POSITIONING_1 - e.g., "My IT security background lets me automate GRC work others do manually", "My audit experience brings rigor to risk assessments that pure GRC folks might miss"]
- [POSITIONING_2 - e.g., "Fresh perspective helps identify process improvements veterans overlook", "Cross-functional experience bridges GRC and technical teams effectively"]

---

## CURRENT SITUATION & CHALLENGES

Team Dynamics: [CONTEXT - e.g., "Team of 1 (just me building program)", "Joining established team of 5 GRC veterans", "Replacing beloved predecessor who left", "Skeptical CISO who wanted someone with more GRC experience"]

Skepticism I'm Facing:
- [CONCERN_1 - e.g., "You don't have formal GRC background", "You're too technical for this strategic role", "Can you really handle executive communication?", "Previous person had 10 years GRC experience"]
- [CONCERN_2 - e.g., "Will you understand the business side?", "This isn't just a security role", "You've never done TPRM before"]

First 90-Day Expectations: [SUCCESS_CRITERIA - e.g., "Complete 20 vendor assessments", "Build initial risk register", "Present GRC program roadmap to executives", "Document current control gaps", "Establish vendor tiering methodology"]

Immediate Pressure Points: [URGENT_NEEDS - e.g., "Audit starting in 6 weeks and I need to prep", "Board asking for risk metrics I don't have", "500+ vendors need classification by Q1", "Control testing backlog from previous person"]

---

## CREDIBILITY-BUILDING STRATEGY

Quick Win Opportunities I See:
- [OPPORTUNITY_1 - e.g., "Manual vendor review process I could automate", "No risk dashboard exists - I could build one", "Documentation is messy - I could organize it", "Process gaps I've already identified"]
- [OPPORTUNITY_2 - e.g., "Stakeholder who needs help with specific problem", "Low-hanging fruit project that's been delayed", "My technical skills solve an existing pain point"]

What Would Build Credibility Fast:
- [WIN_1 - e.g., "Automate something time-consuming the team dreads", "Create executive-ready artifact they've been asking for", "Solve problem that previous person couldn't", "Deliver something ahead of schedule"]
- [WIN_2 - e.g., "Build relationship with skeptical stakeholder", "Demonstrate I can learn GRC frameworks quickly", "Show I bring fresh valuable perspective"]

---

## SUPPORT & RESOURCES

**Note:** Tools and time availability are in your_grc_profile.md. Focus here on role-specific support.

Support Available: [HELP - e.g., "Mentor in another department", "Manager is supportive but hands-off", "Team willing to teach but busy", "External consultant available for questions", "Predecessor left documentation", "No support - figuring it out alone"]

---

## LAB FOCUS & DELIVERABLES

The lab should result in:

- [ARTIFACT_2 - e.g., "Executive presentation showing program maturity", "Metrics showing time/cost savings", "Framework that team adopts"]

Document impact with:

## POSITIONING & COMMUNICATION

How to Frame My Background:

- **To leadership:** [PITCH - e.g., "I bring both strategic thinking AND execution capability", "My cross-functional experience bridges GRC and technical teams", "I can scale this program efficiently"]
- **To my team:** [PEER_FRAMING - e.g., "I'm here to learn from your expertise while adding technical capabilities", "I respect what you've built and want to enhance it", "Let's collaborate on improvements"]

Handling "You're Not Traditional GRC" Comments:
- [RESPONSE_APPROACH - e.g., "Acknowledge gap, emphasize learning agility and transfer of skills", "Show how my background solves their specific pain points", "Point to early wins as proof of capability"]

Asking for Help Without Looking Weak:
- [STRATEGY - e.g., "Frame as 'I want to understand your perspective' not 'I don't know'", "Ask specific questions showing I've done homework", "Position as collaboration: 'How would you approach this?'"]

## 📝 Tips for Success

**Lead with Your Strengths:** Don't hide your background. "I'm bringing automation skills from IT" is powerful. "I'm new to GRC" is weak.

**Document Every Win:** Keep a "credibility journal" - every positive feedback, every time saved, every problem solved. You'll need this when imposter syndrome hits.

**Find Your Champion:** Identify one stakeholder who believes in you early. Their advocacy is worth 10 quick wins when skeptics question you.

**30-Day Quick Wins Are Critical:** You get one chance at first impressions. Deliver something tangible and visible in your first month.

**Ask Smart Questions:** "How have you approached X in the past?" shows respect. "I don't know anything about X" shows unpreparedness.
