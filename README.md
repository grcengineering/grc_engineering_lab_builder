# GRC Engineering Lab Builder

> **Create personalized GRC learning labs tailored to YOUR context, experience, and goals**

Traditional GRC training is one-size-fits-none. This framework generates custom learning experiences that match your technical level, work with your actual systems, and address your specific challenges.

## üöÄ Quick Start (15 minutes to your first lab)

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Complete Your GRC Profile

Open **[your_grc_profile.md](your_grc_profile.md)** and fill in your personal details in the "‚úèÔ∏è YOUR INFORMATION" section.

This tells the AI about:
- Your role and technical background
- Your organization and systems
- Your goals and constraints

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Choose Your Objective

**Pick the prompt that matches where you are:**

| Your Situation | Use This Prompt | What You'll Build |
|----------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| ‚úÖ **Employed in GRC, want to advance** | [employed.md](user_prompts/employed.md) | Executive artifacts, dashboards, automation |
| üîç **Looking for a GRC job** | [job_seeking.md](user_prompts/job_seeking.md) | Portfolio projects, interview prep, demos |
| üîÑ **Transitioning into GRC** | [career_transition.md](user_prompts/career_transition.md) | Quick wins, credibility builders, stakeholder tools |

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Generate Your Lab

1. Open ChatGPT, Claude, or any AI assistant
2. Paste your completed GRC profile
3. Paste your chosen user prompt
4. Submit ‚Üí Get your personalized learning lab!

## üí° What You'll Get

Every lab generates:
- ‚úÖ **Custom learning path** for your exact context
- ‚úÖ **Real work artifacts** (slide decks, dashboards, templates)
- ‚úÖ **Reusable frameworks** you can use forever
- ‚úÖ **Application coaching** for your specific challenges

## üì¶ See Real Examples

| Example | Situation | Lab Goal | Artifact Built | Result |
|---------|-----------|----------|----------------|--------|
| [SOC 2 Parsing](examples/01_employed_soc2_parsing/) | Employed TPRM Lead | Automate vendor doc review | Python extraction tool | 3 hours ‚Üí 30 min per review |
| [Job Portfolio](examples/02_job_seeking_portfolio/) | Career changer seeking role | Build demonstrable projects | GRC portfolio + STAR responses | 3 interviews in 2 weeks |
| [Quick Wins](examples/03_transition_quick_wins/) | IT ‚Üí GRC transition | Establish credibility fast | Process improvement doc | Won over skeptical team |

## üéØ How It Works

```
Your Baseline Context + Specific Goal = Personalized Lab
```

**Example:**
- **You:** TPRM Lead, 500+ vendors, manual reviews taking 3+ hours each
- **Goal:** Learn to parse SOC 2 documents programmatically
- **Lab Output:** 12-week progressive build from zero coding to full automation
- **Result:** Reduce review time from 3 hours to 30 minutes

The lab matches your:
- ‚úÖ Technical skill level (no prior Python experience needed)
- ‚úÖ Business systems (works with Google Drive, spreadsheets you already use)
- ‚úÖ Time constraints (3 hours/week commitment)
- ‚úÖ Real work context (actual vendor documents, your workflow)

## ‚ùì FAQ

**Q: I'm not technical. Will this work for me?**
A: Yes! You specify your technical level in the baseline. Labs adapt from "never coded" to "advanced scripting."

**Q: Which AI tool should I use?**
A: ChatGPT (GPT-4), Claude, or Google Gemini all work great. [Setup guides here](user_prompts/README.md).

**Q: How long does a lab take?**
A: You control it. Specify your time commitment (e.g., "2 hours/week" or "intensive weekend") and the lab adapts.

**Q: Can I use the artifacts I build?**
A: Absolutely! They're yours. Use for work, portfolio, interviews, presentations‚Äîanything.

**Q: Do I need to share my company's confidential information?**
A: No. The baseline context is about your environment structure, not specific data. You control what you share.
