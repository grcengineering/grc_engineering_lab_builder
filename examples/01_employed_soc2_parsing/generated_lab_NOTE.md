# Generated Lab - SOC 2 Document Parsing

**Note:** The full 12-week learning lab would be provided as a Jupyter notebook (`generated_lab.ipynb`) that you can view directly on GitHub.

The complete lab output from the example user shared earlier in this conversation includes all 12 weeks of progressive learning content.

## How to Generate Your Own

Since you have access to the complete example output shared in this conversation, you can:

1. **Use it as a template:** Copy the structure and adapt for your document type
2. **Generate your own version:** Submit the persona + prompt to an AI assistant
3. **Request specific weeks:** Focus on the parts most relevant to your needs

## Viewing the Lab

If this were a real deployed example, you could:

- **View on GitHub:** Jupyter notebooks render beautifully in GitHub's web interface
- **Download and run:** Open in Jupyter Lab locally to execute code cells
- **Read as documentation:** Even without running code, it's a complete guide

---

**To create your own personalized lab:** Go to [system_prompt.md](../../system_prompt.md) and start with your baseline context.
