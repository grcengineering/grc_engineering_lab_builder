# Example: Automated SOC 2 Document Parsing

**Scenario:** Employed TPRM Lead automates vendor document review to save time

---

## 🎯 Lab Overview

**Learner Profile:** Mid-career TPRM Lead at 3,000-person B2B SaaS company
**Challenge:** Manual SOC 2 reviews taking 3+ hours each with 500+ vendors
**Goal:** Automate extraction of key data points to reduce review time to 30-45 minutes
**Time Commitment:** 3 hours/week for 12 weeks
**Technical Level:** Intermediate Python, basic scripting experience

---

## 📊 Results Achieved

| Metric | Before | After | Improvement |
|--------|--------|-------|-------------|
| Time per SOC 2 review | 3+ hours | 30-45 minutes | **75% reduction** |
| Monthly reviews completed | 15 | 40 | **167% increase** |
| Data consistency | Variable (manual entry) | 95%+ (automated extraction) | **Significant improvement** |
| Analyst satisfaction | Tedious manual work | Focus on risk analysis | **Qualitative win** |

## 🗺️ Learning Path Structure

The lab progressed through these phases:

### **Weeks 1-2: Foundation** (No coding)
- Document structure mapping
- Manual baseline measurement
- Pain point identification

### **Weeks 3-5: Core Skills** (Python basics)
- PDF text extraction
- Section finding with regex
- Structured data extraction to CSV

### **Weeks 6-8: Integration** (Batch processing)
- Process multiple PDFs at once
- Upload to Google Sheets automatically
- Build interactive dashboard

### **Weeks 9-10: Advanced** (Pattern recognition)
- Exception pattern analysis
- Automated risk scoring
- Trend identification

### **Weeks 11-12: Production** (Deployment)
- Create runbook and documentation
- Stakeholder presentation
- Plan next iteration

---

## 💡 Key Learnings

### What Worked Well
- **Starting manual:** Weeks 1-2 with no coding built pattern recognition first
- **Progressive complexity:** Each week built on previous, preventing overwhelm
- **Real documents:** Using actual vendor SOC 2 reports (not toy examples) made it immediately applicable
- **Measurable metrics:** Time savings were easy to demonstrate to leadership

### Challenges Overcome
- **PDF variability:** Different vendors format SOC 2 reports differently - regex patterns needed constant refinement
- **Technical hurdles:** Learning Python file handling and Google Sheets API integration
- **Change management:** Getting team to trust automated extraction vs. manual review

### Unexpected Benefits
- **Exception library:** Building a categorized library of common SOC 2 exceptions became a valuable reference
- **Team training:** Runbook made it easy to onboard other analysts to the automation
- **Confidence boost:** Successfully automating one process led to tackling other manual workflows
