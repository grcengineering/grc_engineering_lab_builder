**Role:** TPRM Lead

**Technical Skill Level:** Intermediate Python, SQL comfortable

**Coding Experience:** Basic scripting - can modify existing scripts, written some automation for personal use

**Strongest Technical Areas:** Stakeholder communication, data analysis, Excel/Google Sheets proficiency

**Technical Learning Gaps:** API integration, infrastructure concepts, database queries beyond basic SELECT statements, CI/CD workflows

**Preferred Learning Style:** Hands-on practice with real examples, visual examples showing before/after, step-by-step guidance with clear explanations

**Career Stage:** Mid-career (6 years in GRC)

**Time Availability:** 3 hours/week consistently (Sunday mornings)

---

## Professional & Organizational Profile

**Team Structure:** 25-person GRC team, I report to Risk Manager, have 2 junior analysts supporting me

**Industry:** B2B SaaS Tech

**Company Scale:** 3,000-person company, growing rapidly (30% YoY)

**Years in GRC:** 6 years total (3 years in audit, 3 years in TPRM)

**Employment Status:** Employed full-time

**Company Growth Stage:** Scaling rapidly, Series C funded, preparing for IPO in 2-3 years

**GRC Team Maturity:** Established processes (been around 4 years), but struggling to scale with company growth

---

## Governance & Stakeholder Environment

**Board Structure:** Quarterly risk committee with 3 board members

**Stakeholder Ecosystem:** CISO (my skip-level manager), CFO, Legal (General Counsel), Business unit heads (Sales, Engineering, Product)

**Decision Authority:** Centralized risk team makes vendor approval decisions, but business units can escalate

**Communication Patterns:** Monthly executive briefings to CISO/CFO, quarterly board risk committee presentation

**Risk Culture:** Balanced - innovation-friendly but post-SOC 2 certification we're more risk-aware

**Executive GRC Literacy:** Basic understanding - they get why we do it but need translation to business impact

---

## Risk & Vendor Management

**Risk Methodology:** Quantitative analysis preferred (want to move from qualitative to quantitative scoring)

**Vendor Ecosystem:** 500+ vendors and growing (adding 5-10 new vendors monthly), critical supplier focus on ~50 vendors

**Assessment Tools:** Custom Google Sheets for tracking, GitLab issues for vendor follow-ups, no formal GRC platform yet (evaluating options)

**Regulatory Environment:** SOC 2 Type 2 (certified 18 months ago), GDPR compliant, preparing for ISO 27001

**Risk Appetite Statement:** Informally understood (documented at high level but not quantified)

**Vendor Assessment Cadence:** Annual reviews for all vendors, quarterly for critical vendors - but falling behind due to manual workload

---

## Business Systems & Technology

**Platform Environment:** Google Workspace (Gmail, Drive, Sheets, Docs, Slides)

**Document Systems:** Google Drive (organized by vendor folders)

**Workflow Tools:** Slack for team communication, Google Docs for documentation, GitLab issues for tracking

**Reporting Systems:** Google Sheets dashboards (manual updates), some Looker dashboards from eng team

**Data Infrastructure:** Spreadsheet-based (multiple Google Sheets linked together), exploring data warehouse

**Automation Current State:** Basic Google Apps Script for some spreadsheet automation, Python scripts for personal use, want to expand significantly

---

## Current Organizational Challenges

1. **Manual vendor reviews taking 3+ hours each** - With 500+ vendors, I can't keep up with annual review cadence. Spending 15 hours/week just on document review (SOC 2, insurance certs, security questionnaires).

2. **Inconsistent risk scoring** - Three analysts scoring vendors, results vary widely. Need quantitative methodology so scores are defensible and consistent.

3. **Board wants metrics dashboard** - Quarterly meetings want "vendor risk at a glance" but our data is scattered across 20+ Google Sheets. Manual aggregation takes a full day before each meeting.

4. **Scaling problem** - Company adding 5-10 vendors monthly. Current manual process doesn't scale. CISO has asked "how will we handle 1000+ vendors?"

5. **Career growth blocked** - Want promotion to Senior TPRM Lead but need to show I can think strategically, not just execute tactically. Automation would free me up for program strategy.

**Challenge Priority:** Board mandate + efficiency gain (CISO pressure)

**Resource Constraints:** Understaffed (just me + 2 junior analysts for 500 vendors), limited budget (GRC platform evaluation on hold), no data engineering support

**Success Metrics:**
- Reduce SOC 2 review time from 3 hours to under 1 hour
- Complete 100% of annual vendor reviews (currently at 60%)
- Consistent risk scores across analysts (measured by inter-rater reliability)
- Real-time vendor risk dashboard for executive team
