## 💬 Learner Testimonial

> *"I was terrified in my first week. The CISO made it clear he wanted someone with a compliance background, and the compliance team treated me like I didn't belong. But the quick wins framework from this lab gave me a roadmap. Delivering measurable value in first 30 days changed everything. By day 90, I was leading GRC automation initiatives and the CISO was asking me to present to the board."*
