## 💬 Learner Testimonial

> *"As a career changer, I was terrified I'd never compete with people who had GRC titles on their resumes. But building these three projects gave me something concrete to discuss. In every interview, we spent more time talking about my projects than my lack of traditional experience. The portfolio made me memorable."*
